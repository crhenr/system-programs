# Unix system programs

This repository contains the implementation of different Unix system programs in C. They were written for an assignment of the operating systems classes I took. The goal is to use and **understand** the main POSIX system calls.

Uploaded here for anyone who appreciates operating systems or wants a quick reference.

### Implemented programs:
1. [date](src/date.c);
2. [uptime](src/uptime.c);
3. [ls](src/ls.c);
4. [cp](src/cp.c);
5. [rm](src/rm.c);
6. [mv](src/mv.c);
7. [cat](src/cat.c);
8. [mkdir](src/mkdir.c);
9. [rmdir](src/rmdir.c);
10. [chmod](src/chmod.c);
11. [chown](src/chown.c);
12. [ps](src/ps.c).

Note that these programs are simplified versions of the original ones since they were written for learning purposes.
